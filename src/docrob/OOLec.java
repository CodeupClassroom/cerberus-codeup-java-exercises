        // what is a class?
            // custom data type
            // like math, can also be a group of related utility functions (static)

        // what is an object?

        // make a simple class
            // fighter with name and health fields
            // make them public for now

        // why make object classes?
            // to represent the concepts that are what the program is about (design)
            // to group together fields and methods that have something in common (code organization)

            // what are static methods used for?
                // utility classes like Math
                // or when you want to call the method on a class but should not have to have an instance to do it
                    // e.g., BUILDER methods

        // where does the main() go?
            // writing a 2 file program!
            // can fighter have a main()?

        // show my console adventure demo and how many files it has
            // and what each of the game files represents

        // public vs. private fields?
            // how to change if private?

        // 1. constructors
            // overloading constructors

        // 2. getters and setters

        // public private guidelines
            // private default for fields
            // private default for methods

        // the toString method

        // this reference
            // make a printThis method that shows what THIS really refers to

        // finish with a goblin class that can exchange hits with the Fighter
